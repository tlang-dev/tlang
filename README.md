# TLang
Write once, generate everywhere!

TLang helps generate code in other languages. Create your template with the TLand syntax and use it to generate files in other languages such as Java, TypeScript, Scala, Dart, ...
This will ease the management of boilerplate code.

You can generate a few files, or most of your project with ready to use templates and frameworks
